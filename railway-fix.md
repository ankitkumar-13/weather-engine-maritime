# ðŸš€ Railway Deployment Fix

## Issue Fixed
The Railway deployment failed because of incorrect start command and import paths.

## Changes Made:
1. **Fixed railway.json** - Removed `cd` command
2. **Fixed imports** - Updated to use `src.` prefix
3. **Added nixpacks.toml** - Explicit Nixpacks configuration
4. **Updated Dockerfile** - Better Python path handling

## Next Steps:

### Push the fixes to GitHub:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Railway deployment configuration"
git push
```

### Railway will automatically redeploy with the fixes.

### Alternative Quick Fix in Railway Dashboard:
If you want to fix it directly in Railway:

1. Go to your Railway project dashboard
2. Click on **Settings** â†’ **Environment**
3. Add these environment variables:
   ```
   PYTHONPATH=/app/backend
   PORT=8000
   ```
4. Go to **Settings** â†’ **Deploy**
5. Change **Start Command** to: `python backend/main.py`
6. Click **Deploy**

Your backend should now deploy successfully! ðŸŽ‰
